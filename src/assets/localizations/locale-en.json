Studying with a mentor, the students solve problems on their own, while the mentor guides the student in the right direction and can give professional answers to the questions that arise.</p>\n<p>Community support, sharing of the experience and learning difficulties, that will appear really helpful for a future specialist in any field. The manager's confidence in his employees - in the ability to solve problems on their own, take responsibility, make decisions based on BestPractice, perform the work without the need for step-by-step instructions - perfectly distinguishes the specialist from his colleagues.Such a learning method is much more effective than lecture courses or just tasks which are supposed to be solved without any help.</p>"
